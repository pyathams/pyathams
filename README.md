Hi there 👋 I'm @pyathams
👀 I’m interested in exploring and building full-stack applications, blockchain technology, and smart contracts.
🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and Ethereum development to expand my skills in decentralized applications (dApps).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source blockchain projects, smart contracts, and web development using modern front-end technologies like React, Vite, and Node.js.
